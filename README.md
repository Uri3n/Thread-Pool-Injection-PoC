# Thread-Pool-Injection-PoC
Proof of concept code for thread pool based process injection in Windows.

Credit goes to 0xDeku from the SafeBreach Labs for publishing the original research
for this technique.
0xDeku's research and code:
https://www.safebreach.com/blog/process-injection-using-windows-thread-pools
https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/PoolParty

Please note however that while the code in this repository utilizes the same technique discovered by 
SafeBreach labs, it is not a copy, and it is not a redistribution. I spent a good deal of time reimplementing
this technique myself.

I made a write-up on this. If you want, you can check it out here:
